<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
3rd Party API Integration Demo

![3rd Party API Integration Demo](third-party-api-demo.gif)

This project was designed to teach us about fetching 2 third party APIs and displaying their data on our webpage. 

Here's why we're doing this:
* Understand the functionailty of fetching and appending 3rd party API data
* Experience organizational file structure with a real repo and development team
* Showcase the importance of local storage

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

GIVEN a search form:
- [x] WHEN I launch the app,
      THEN I am presented with a full screen modal welcoming me to the Taylor Swift experience
- [x] WHEN I dismiss the modal and get to the main application,
      THEN I am presented with a web page containing a search form and a list of Taylor Swift albums. 
- [x] WHEN I submit a search for one of Taylor Swift's albums in the list,
      THEN data is pulled from 2 third party API's (Giphy and Wikipedia)
- [x] WHEN I submit a correct search for one of Taylor Swift's albums in the list,
      THEN I am presented with a positive alert message
- [x] WHEN I submit a search for one of Taylor Swift's albums in the list,
      THEN I am presented with a link to its wikipedia page and gif
- [x] WHEN I submit a search (not using an album from the list),
      THEN I am only presented with a relevant gif
